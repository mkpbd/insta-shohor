      <!--how dose javascript work-->
      <section class="mt-5 shadow-sm p-5 mb-3">
        <h3>How does javascript work ?</h3>
        <p>
          javascript is primarily a client-site scripting language. A webpage
          can contain embedded javascript which executes a user visits the page
          So that they could make our web pages interactive or simple tasks.
          Today browser scripting remains the main use case of javascript, But
          one important thing to remember is that the client's web browser also
          needs to support the javascript or it must have javascript enabled.
          nowadays most web browsers support javascript and have their
          javascript engines, for example, Google Chrome has its own JavaScript
          Engine called V8
          <br />
          This is the first stage of the engine every time we run a javascript
          programs our code is first receive by the parser inside the javascript
          Engine. The parser's job is to check the javascript code for syntactic
          error in line by line manner becuase JavaScript is an interpretive
          scripting language so whenver an error is detected the parser it
          throws a kind of error and stops execution of the code
        </p>

      <!--javascript event loops -->
      <section class="mt-3 shadow-sm p-5 mb-3">
        <h3>What is even loop ?</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript has a runtime model base on even loop Which is responsible
          for executing code collecting and processing events executing The
          event loop is the secret behind javascript asynchronous programming.
          <br />
          JS executes all operations on a single thread but using a few smart
          data structures it gives us the multi-threading
          <br />
          1. The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the
          operation in line to be executed whenever a function is finished, it
          is popped from the stack <br />
          2. The even queue is responsible for sending new functions to the
          stack for processing. <br />
          it follow the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence
          all operation should be sent for execution whenever an asynchronous
          function is called it is sent to a browser API, These are APIs built
          into the browser base on command receive from the stack the API starts
          its own single-threaded operation example setTimeout() function ,
          clearTimeout()
          <br />
          If a function Tasks a long time to execute we can not interact with
          the web browser during the function's execution because the page
          hangs. The event loop is a constantly runnig process that monition
          both the callback queue and the call stack If the call stack is not
          empty the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next
          function from the callback queue to the call stack, if the callback
          queue is empty nothing will happen

      <!-- sessiongStorage and localStorage -->
      <section class="shadow-sm p-5">
        <h3>What is difference localstorage between sessionStorage ?</h3>
        <p>
          LocalStorage and SessionStorage are almost identical and have the same
          API, The difference is that with sessionStorage, the data is persisted
          only until the window or tab is closed. In the LocalStorage the data
          is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until
          your web page clears the data. but the syntax for sessionStorage are
          same we can create, read, and update key/value pairs in localStorage
          we can create entries for the localStorage object by using the
          setItem() method. The setItem() method takes two arguments the key and
          corresponding value to read entries use the getItem() the getItem()
          method take one arguments deleting and clearing Entries we can delete
          an entry with the removeItem() the removeItem() method takes one
          argument which will be a key of the localStorage object
          <br />
          localStorage use for long term use on the other hand SessionStorage
          use when we need to store somthing that changes or somthing temporary
